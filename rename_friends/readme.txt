This plugin allows an admin to relabel the Elgg "friends" relationship
to something more fitting for your site.

This plugin aims to provide a versatile way to name them
whatever you want, in different languages.

Go to the plugin settings, enter in the singular version
and the plural version of what you want friends to be relabeled.

Supports the following language string sources:

Default Notification Settings
Elgg Core
Extendafriend
Friend Request
Groups

This plugin must be below all of these plugins to work properly.
This plugin will support multiple languages if someone wants to
provide translations of the language file.
